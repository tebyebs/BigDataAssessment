**Question 1**

Show a histogram of the population growth rate, and a separate histogram of the generation time of your subset of species. Describe the patterns. Do they make sense to you?

```{r warning=FALSE}
#Calculating the population growth rate by finding the dominant eigenvalue of each matrix, then storing this in the reptiles dataframe
comadre_reptiles$lambda <- unlist(lapply(matA(comadre_reptiles), popbio::lambda))

#Calculating gen time using the rage function
comadre_reptiles$gen_T <- mapply(Rage::gen_time, matU(comadre_reptiles), matF(comadre_reptiles))

#ensuring a clean version of the dataset for phylogenies
comadre_reptiles_clean <- comadre_reptiles |>
  filter(!is.na(lambda), 
         !is.na(gen_T), 
         !is.infinite(gen_T))
```

```{r warnings = F}
#Plotting the pop growth rate histogram - red abline represents a stable population that is neither growing nor shrinking
hist(comadre_reptiles_clean$lambda, xlab= "Population growth rate", main = NULL) 
  abline(v = 1, col = 'red', lty = 2, lwd = 2)
```

```{r warnings = F}
#Plotting generation time histogram
hist(comadre_reptiles_clean$gen_T, xlab = "Generation time (years)", main = NULL)
```

The pop growth rate histogram shows that the majority of populations have a $\lambda$ close to 1, suggesting relatively stable population growth rates. There are, however, a few populations that have $\lambda$ values significantly lower than 1, suggesting a declining population, perhaps due to climate change. Conversely, there is a wide variety in populations with $\lambda$ values greater than one, with some populations growing steadily but others with explosive growth, such as the population with a $\lambda$ close to 2.5.

Similarly, most of the generation times are below 20 years, suggesting that most studied reptiles have short reproductive time-spans. The distribution is skewed, however, with some outlier populations that have longer (20-40 years) or significantly longer (50-80 years) generation times, but the frequency of such populations declines as the generation time increases.

**Question 2**

Fit a model to explore whether the generation time and population growth rate of your
speciesâ€™ populations are correlated. Would you have expected them to be correlated? Why?
